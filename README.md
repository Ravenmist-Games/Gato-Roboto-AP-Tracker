# Gato Roboto Tracker for Archipelago

This is a PopTracker pack developed for Gato Roboto. As this pack is intended for use with [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/), you can connect it to a MultiWorld server to be used as an **autotracker**.

## Prerequisites 

- [**PopTracker**](https://poptracker.github.io/)
- [**Gato Roboto**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/916730/Gato_Roboto/)

For anyone using Archipelago:
- [**Gato Roboto APWorld Latest Release**](https://github.com/Ravenmist-Games/Gato-Roboto-APWorld/releases/latest)

## Installation

Visit the [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/Ravenmist-Games/Gato-Roboto-AP-Tracker/releases/latest) to find the latest build. Download the source code and place it in the `poptracker/packs` folder. Launch PopTracker and the pack should be visible to load!

## Connecting to a Multi-World Server

*Make sure the server is running.*

Once the pack is open, click the AP icon at the top and enter the `IP Address` (or `Hostname`) and `Port` separated with a `:` symbol (Ex. `archipelago.gg:38281`) for your server.

You will then be prompted for the slot name to connect to. Input your slot name chosen during YAML creation in the command line at the bottom of the client. 

You will then be prompted to enter a password for the server, if there is one.

It will take a moment to connect, but once the AP icon turns green you are all set!
